# Pattern-Recognition-A1


#### 1.  Generate data
*  Class 0: Gaussian centered at (-1, -1)
*  Class 1: Gaussian centered at (1, -1)
#### 2.  Use (1) as data set
*  Set up a perceptron classifier
*  Report training performance
*  Do K-fold cross validation
*  Report confusion matrix
#### 3.  Repeat (1)-(2) by adding to Class 0 a Gaussian cluster centered at (1, 1)
#### 4.  Repeat (1)-(2) by adding to Class 1 a Gaussian cluster centered at (-1, 1)
#### 5.  Repeat (4) by using a multi-layered classifier; use TensorFlow or Keras. No need to do cross validation. Separate training and test sets would be sufficient.
